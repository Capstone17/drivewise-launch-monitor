## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* `imageio` for reading video files
* `opencv-python` for ArUco marker detection
* The `ultralytics` package for running YOLOv8 models
* `golf_ball_detector.onnx` (your trained model file) placed in the
  repository root

Install the required Python packages with:

```bash
pip install imageio opencv-python ultralytics
```

## To-Do
At some point, let's rewrite this README to be more complete and relevant, and rename/organize our repository main branch.
We will all most likely have this in our resume for a while after 440 ends, and it would be good for our code to look professional.
